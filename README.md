 
 ## Vision
SafeClassify is an open-source project aimed at automating the detection and classification of sensitive data. It provides businesses, developers, and researchers with a powerful tool to ensure regulatory compliance and data privacy.
                      SafeClassify (Smart Data Classifier)

The Purpose:
   
  "The purpose of SafeClassify is to provide a powerful, open-source tool for detecting and classifying sensitive data, enabling businesses, developers, and researchers to maintain regulatory compliance and ensure data privacy."


What problem does SafeClassify aim to solve?

   "Sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial records, and health data, is often mishandled due to lack of effective tools for automated detection and classification. This can lead to legal risks and data breaches."
Describe the Solution:

How SafeClassify addresses the problem.
  
 "SafeClassify provides a lightweight, modular framework to automatically identify and classify sensitive data in structured datasets. By offering confidence levels for classifications and detailed reports, it simplifies regulatory compliance and strengthens data privacy."
